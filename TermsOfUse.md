# Jamf Setup Manager Terms of Use

## Non-Product/Add-On Software

This application is an add-on utility that may enhance your use of Jamf Pro. However, it is not a part of the Jamf Product Line and as such is not eligible for support via our normal product support channels. It has not been tested or validated by Jamf's internal compliance, security, and quality processes. We make no representation about when or if the utility will become a part of the Jamf Product line or when or in what form its functionality might be integrated into other Jamf Products.

## Privacy

We send an anonymous event notification to our monitoring system whenever the app is launched. The collected data is used to measure the project's adoption and helps us prioritize future development.

The data format of the event record is as follows: {"uuid": "<uuid>", "event": "Setup Manager - Launch"}. The "uuid" value is randomly-generated. The application will not collect or transmit information about you, your organization, your users, or anything related to the device being used or the data it contains.

## Testing

We make no representation that the software will perform or continue to perform as intended in your environment. You agree to test the software in a non-production environment and independently evaluate its functionality prior to any use that may impact your operations.
