#  Setup Manager - Change Log

## v1.1.1
(2025-01-28)

- updated included Installomator script to [v10.7](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/releases/tag/v10.7)

## v1.1
(2024-10-23)
### New Features

- new action [`waitForUserEntry`](ConfigurationProfile.md#wait-for-user-entry) which allows for two-phase installation workflows in Jamf Pro. When Setup Manager reaches this action it will wait for the user entry to save the data entry, then it will run a recon/Update Inventory. Policy actions that follow this, can then be scoped to data from the user entry. (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#11)
- data from user entry is now written to a file when Setup Manager submits data. See details in [User Entry](Docs/Extras.md#user-data-file) (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#9)
- use token substitution in the `title`, `message`, and action `label` values (as well as `computerNameTemplate`)
- token substitution can extract center characters with `:=n`
- localization of custom text in the configuration profile has been simplified. The previous method still works, but is considered deprecated. [Details in the documentation](ConfigurationProfile.md#localization). The [plist and profile example files](Examples) have been updated.

### Fixes and improvements

1.1beta:

- icons using `symbol:` that end in `.app` now work properly
- Elapsed time is shown in "About this Mac…" Start time is shown with option key.
- svg and pdf images used for `icon`s should now work
- general fixes in user entry setup
- improved rendering in Help View (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#12)
- fixes to json schema
- improved and updated documentation
- included Installomator script updated to [v10.6](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator/releases/v10.6)
- added Setup Manager version and macOS version and build to tracking ping
- fixed UI glitch in macOS Sequoia

1.1 release:

- documentation updates and fixes (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#35, Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#44, Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#48, Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#51)
- custom `accentColor` now works correctly with SF Symbol icons (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#41)
- setting a `placeholder` no longer overrides a `default` in `userEntry` (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#43)
- more UI updates
- Hebrew localization

### Beta features

Even though we are confident that the 1.1 release is overall stable and ready to be used in production, we believe this feature may require more testing. When, after thorough testing in your environment, you conclude this works for your workflow, please let us know about success or any issues you might encounter.

- Setup Manager can now run over Login Window, instead of immediately after installation. This also allows Setup Manager to work with AutoAdvance. Use [the new `runAt` key](ConfigurationProfile.md#runAt) in the profile to determine when Setup Manager runs (Jamf-Concepts/Setup-Manager#18)

### Deprecations

These features are marked for removal in a future release:

- localized labels and text by adding the two-letter language code to key. Switch to [localization with dictionaries](ConfigurationProfile.md#localization). 
- `showBothButtons` key and functionality

- Norwegian and Swedish localizations, thanks to Sam Wennerlund
- refactored process launching code, this should help with some stalling issues
- shutdown button should not stall anymore
- Setup Manager now caches the defaults at launch. This makes it more resilient to its configuration profile "disappearing" because the computer is not scope. (We still recommend scoping the Setup Manager Configuration profile as well as adding it to the Prestage.) This also addresses the custom UI "flickering" while it runs. (#21)

## v0.9

(2023-10-26)

- "About this Mac" info window
  - now shows network connection status. With the option key, the info window shows the interface name and IP address
  - to keep the info window clean, some (more) items are now only shown when opening the info window while holding option keys (Jamf Pro and Setup Manager version)
- updated Installomator to v10.5
- added new defaults key `overrideSerialNumber` to display a preset serial number, this is useful for creating screenshots or recordings
- main window is not resizable (#26)
- user entry with options menu would be empty unless manually set (#23)
- item progress indicators are now more distinct (#25)
- added "Powered by Jamf" and icon in button bar

- fixed a strange race condition that led to large installomator installations stalling with Jamf School
- 'Shutdown' button is now hidden by default, since it breaks some of the workflows. You can unhide it by setting the `finalAction` key to `shutdown` (this will hide the continue button) or setting the `showBothButtons` key to `true` which will show both buttons.
